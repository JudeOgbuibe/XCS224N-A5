It's a true story -- every bit of this is true.
Soon after Tipper and I left the -- (Mock sob) White House --  we were driving from our home in Nashville a a little farm farm we 50 50 miles east Nashville. Nashville. Nashville.
Driving ourselves.
I have been sounds away by little thing to you, but --  I looked in the rear-view mirror and all of a a it it just hit me. There was was no back there.
